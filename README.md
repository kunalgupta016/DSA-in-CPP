# 🚀 DSA in C++

Welcome to my repository for learning and implementing **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using C++! 🌟 This journey covers fundamental to advanced topics in DSA, with examples and problem-solving techniques.

## 📚 Topics Covered

1. **📋 Arrays**
   - Implementation of arrays and common operations like insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching.
   - Problems solved using arrays, including:
     - Finding the largest/smallest element
     - Array rotations
     - Subarray problems (Kadane's algorithm, etc.)

2. **🧵 Strings**
   - String manipulation techniques (concatenation, comparison, etc.)
   - Solving common string problems like:
     - Palindrome check
     - Substring search (KMP algorithm, etc.)
     - Anagram detection

3. **🔄 Recursion**
   - Implementation of recursive algorithms for:
     - Factorial, Fibonacci series, Tower of Hanoi, etc.
   - Backtracking problems like:
     - N-Queens, Sudoku solver, etc.

4. **📌 Pointers**
   - Understanding pointers and their use cases in memory management.
   - Pointer arithmetic, dynamic memory allocation, and working with functions.

5. **🔍 Searching and Sorting Algorithms**
   - **🔎 Searching Algorithms:**
     - Linear Search
     - Binary Search
   - **🔄 Sorting Algorithms:**
     - Bubble Sort
     - Selection Sort
     - Insertion Sort
     - Merge Sort
     - Quick Sort

6. **🧩 Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)**
   - Key concepts of OOPs:
     - Classes and Objects
     - Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism
   - Implementation of OOP concepts in real-world problem-solving.

7. **🔗 Linked Lists**
   - Implementation of Singly and Doubly Linked Lists.
   - Operations on Linked Lists such as:
     - Insertion, Deletion, Traversal, and Reversal.
   - Solving problems using linked lists, including:
     - Detecting a loop
     - Finding the middle element
     - Merging two sorted linked lists
